# bitcoin-explorer-rpc

This is a simple block explorer I made using a tutorial as a guideline:
https://medium.com/@peterjd42/build-your-own-bitcoin-api-using-node-js-and-bitcoin-core-251e613623db

using nodejs, my own bitcoin node for sending the RPC requests, and
a little react for the front-end.

You'll will have ot use your own bitcoin node, since mine is at home and my ISP doesn't grant static IP addresses :(. So it's 
behind my fiber router, and the router has the public IP, and I still don't know how to provide public IP addresses to each one of 
the laptops I have in my home network. It's working through TOR network, and I was already able to make SSH connections using TOR,
but I can't do the HTTP requests thorugh TOR just yet. working on that

I'm not sure if I can put the MIT license for my work (which is still under construction,
but I'm using this also as git/git-hub practice). But I'll do it anyway.
